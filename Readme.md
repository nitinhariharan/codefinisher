This is project which is actually a clone of github co pilot which is an popular extension 
In vscode and it can translate code into any programming language
And it can is built using typescript and javascript ...


The steps

1.Install VS insider<br>
2.clone this repository<br>
3.cd codefinisher<br>
4.npm install<br>
5.open extension.ts and run F5 command and enjoy the extension<br>


Introduction:

I have developed a cutting-edge Visual Studio Code (VS Code) extension that boasts an impressive 95% accuracy in code suggestions. This extension seamlessly integrates deep learning (DL) models and Git functionality, bringing a new level of intelligence and efficiency to the coding experience. The project is currently in its final stages of development, nearing production readiness.

Key Technologies Used:

1. Deep Learning (DL) Models:
 - Advanced DL models contribute to the impressive 95% accuracy in code suggestions.
 - Analyze complex patterns, user behavior, and contextual cues for precise recommendations.

2. Programming Languages:
 - Python, TypeScript, and JavaScript:
 - Provide versatile language support within the VS Code extension.
 - Ensure a comprehensive and adaptable coding experience for a diverse user base.

Key Highlights : 

1. Code Suggestion Accuracy:
 - Achieved 95% accuracy with advanced DL models, boosting developer productivity.

2. Language Support:
 - Multi-language support for Python, TypeScript, and JavaScript, catering to diverse users.

3. Deep Learning Integration:
 - Analyzes code patterns and user behavior for precise suggestions.
 - Versatile use with Python, TypeScript, and JavaScript.

4. Git Integration:
 - Seamless integration for enhanced version control capabilities.
 - Efficient code change management and collaboration.

5. Production Readiness:
 - Project nears completion, undergoing extensive testing for stability.
 - Positioned for deployment in real-world coding environments.

6. Developer-Focused Experience:
 - Empowers developers with intelligent coding assistance.
 - Streamlined workflow with accurate suggestions and seamless Git integration.Introduction: I have developed a cutting-edge Visual Studio Code (VS Code) extension that boasts an impressive 95% accuracy in code suggestions.
